----------

This program uses and ships with the source code of the following libraries:
* Eigen v3.2.8
* SG++ v1.1.0 "base" package

For copyright details of these components, please see below.

----------

Eigen - C++ Template Library for Linear Algebra (v3.2.8)
<http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/>

Eigen is primarily MPL2 licensed. See COPYING.MPL2 and these links:
  http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/
  http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/FAQ.html

Some files contain third-party code under BSD or LGPL licenses, whence the other
COPYING.* files here.

All the LGPL code is either LGPL 2.1-only, or LGPL 2.1-or-later.
For this reason, the COPYING.LGPL file contains the LGPL 2.1 text.

----------

SG++ - Sparse Grid Toolbox (v1.1.0)
<http://sgpp.sparsegrids.org/>

NOTE: Only partial code---the "base" package---from SG++ is included in this program.

The software SG++ is developed by The SG++ Project which is the
owner of the software.

According to good scientific practice, publications on results
achieved in whole or in part due to SG++ have to cite at least one
paper presenting the SG++ software.

The owner wishes to make the software available to all users to use,
reproduce, modify, distribute and redistribute also for commercial
purposes under the following conditions of the original BSD
license. Linking the SG++ module statically or dynamically with other
modules is making a combined work based on SG++. Thus, the terms and
conditions of this license cover the whole combination. As a special
exception, the copyright holders of SG++ give you permission to link
it with independent modules or to instantiate templates and macros
from SG++'s source files to produce an executable, regardless of the
license terms of these independent modules, and to copy and distribute
the resulting executable under terms of your choice, provided that you
also meet, for each linked independent module, the terms and
conditions of this license of that module.
