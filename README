- src/   : contains all source code
- dep/   : contains 2 required libraries (SGpp and Eigen)
- input/ : contains all necessary input data files
- bin/   : contains all binaries and executables **git ignored

Compilation
------------------ 

1. SGpp library (Prerequisite):

1.1 To compile:
$: scons sgpp
$: scons sgpp impipath=<impi_install_path>

1.2 Then export library path:
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<basepath>/lib/SGpp/lib/sgpp:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

1.3 NOTE: SGpp might need to be re-compiled on different types of nodes.


2. Compile eBayes

2.1 To compile:
$: scons
$: scons <option>=<value>
e.g.
$: scons impi=True impipath=$IMPIPATH exe=ebayes_impi

2.2 To clean up:
$: scons -c
or
$: rm -rf bin


------------------
Execution
------------------

mpiexec -n 4 ./bin/run

srun -n 4 configfile /path/to/runtime/config/file bin/run > console.out
